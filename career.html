The reason that I want to be an engineer is because I like to expirment with things and test things until I get them working properly.  I also like to make and do things on computers as it can be fun plus it can save resources by testing your idea in a simulated evironmnet.  Which would be similar to how it would feel in real life to get an idea on how well your idea will work in the real world.</p></div>
